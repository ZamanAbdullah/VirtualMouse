# VirtualMouse
In this repository I have created a virtual mouse which can be controlled by the hand gesture 
In this project I have used mediapipe by google to find the landmark on the hand
mediapipe help by drawing the landmarks on the Hand
Our hand has totally 21 landmarks ranging from 0 to 21
Our index finger has the index number 8,with that index number the movement of the mouse is controlled 
A powerful package called PyAutogui is used to move the mouse 
If you want to click then you have to join your index and thumb finger 
I have given that the distance between the thumb and index is less than 20 a click operation must be done
If you want to reduce you can reduce according to your wish,but if you give a very smaller number then your index finger will move away from the target and the click operation can be done on another place 
To reduce this issue I have given the distance close to 20
